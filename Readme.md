# create-bento

create-bento is a simple, opinionated way to bootstrap a react library built with typescript and storybook. I built this because I was getting tired of configuring my react libraries and I wasn't entirely happy with the various existing solutions.

## Usage

Currently, create-bento requires yarn. Create a new library using the following command:

```
yarn create bento my-library-name
```

Follow the provided instructions to get started working on your library.
