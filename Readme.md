# bento-box

Bento-box is a simple starter for building react libraries using typescript because I was tired of coming up with build solutions for every new project. This uses storybook to help develop your components and uses typescript, rollup and babel to build your library.

## Getting started

Clone this repository to your computer and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/bmcmahen/bento-box.git
cd bento-box
yarn
```

Ensure that you change the name of your project in `package.json` and update the `version`, `description`, and `author` fields.

## Running storybook

```
yarn run storybook
```

## Building your library

```
yarn run build
```
