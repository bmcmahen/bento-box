# Create Bento

`create-bento` is a simple, somewhat opinionated way to bootstrap a react library built with Typescript and Storybook. If you'd rather not use storybook or if you prefer regular javascript, I'd recommend using [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library).

## Usage

Currently, `create-bento` requires yarn. Create a new library using the following command:

```
yarn global add create-bento
create-bento my-project-name
```

And then follow the provided instructions to get started working on your library.
